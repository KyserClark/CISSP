## Risk

### NIST Risk Management Framework
Incorporates the key elements of risk management; geared toward federal government entities.
* SP 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations
* SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk
* SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
   
### ISO-IEC 27005
Provides guidelines for information security risk management in an organization but does not dictate a specific approach for implementing it.

### OCTAVE
Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE); Risk assessment methodology is divided into three phases.
* Organizational view that defines threat profiles on critical assets
* Look at organization's technology infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities
* Analize and classify individual risks as high, medium, or low and develop mitigations

### FAIR
Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR); Proprietary framework for understanding, analyzing, and measuring information risk. The only standard quantitative approach to managing risk.

**********************************************************************   
## Security Programs

### ISO-IEC 27000 Series
Industry best practices for the management of security controls in a holistic manner.
* **ISO/IEC 27000** Overview and vocabulary
* **ISO/IEC 27001** ISMS requirements
* **ISO/IEC 27002** Code of practice for information security controls
* **ISO/IEC 27003** ISMS implementation guidance
* **ISO/IEC 27004** ISMS monitoring, measurement, analysis, and evaluation
* **ISO/IEC 27005** Information security risk management
* **ISO/IEC 27007** ISMS auditing guidelines
* **ISO/IEC 27014** Information security governance
* **ISO/IEC 27017** Security controls for cloud services
* **ISO/IEC 27019** Security for process control in the energy industry
* **ISO/IEC 27031** Business continuity
* **ISO/IEC 27033** Network security
* **ISO/IEC 27034** Application security
* **ISO/IEC 27035** Incident management

*Exam tip: Do NOT have to memorize the entire ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards.*

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Voluntary framework for critical infrastucture organizations; three main components:
* Framework Core
   * Identify
   * Protect
   * Respond
   * Recover 
* Implementation Tiers
* Framework Profile

********************************************************************** 
## Security Controls

### NIST SP 800-53
Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations; Made for compliance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS).
* 1. Select the appropriate security control baselines.
* 2. Tailor the baselines.
* 3. Document the security control selection process.
* 4. Apply the controls

### CIS Controls
Center for Internet Security (CIS); a list of 20 critical security controls designed to mitigate the threat of the majority of common cyberattacks.

### COBIT 2019
Control Objectives for Information Technologies (COBIT); helps organizations optimize the value of their IT by tying stakeholder drivers and needs to organizational and IT goals.

**********************************************************************
## Enterprise Architecture

### Zachman Framework
A two-dimensional model that uses six basic communication interrogatives (What, How, Where, Who, When, and Why) intersecting with different perspectives (Executives, Business Managers, System Architects, Engineers, Technicians, and Enterprise-wide) to give a holistic understanding of the enterprise. 

### TOGAF
The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF); provides an approach to design, implement, and govern an enterprise information architecture.
* Business architecture
* Data architecture
* Applications architecture
* Technology architecture

### DoDAF
Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF); an architecture that has to span many different complex government agencies to allow for interoperability and proper hierarchical communication channels.

### SABSA
Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA); a layered framework that provides a chain of traceability through the contextual, conceptual, logical, physical, component, and operational levels.

**********************************************************************   
## Other

### ITIL
Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL); Standard for IT service management to meet business needs.
 
### Six Sigma
Improve process quality by using statistical methods of measuring operation efficiency and reducing variation, defects, and waste.  
 
### Capability Maturity Model
(CMM): Structured steps that can be followed so an organization can evolve from one level to the next and constantly improve its processes and security posture.
