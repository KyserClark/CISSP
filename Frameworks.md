## Risk

### NIST Risk Management Framework
Incorporates the key elements of risk management; geared toward federal government entities.
* SP 800-37, Revision 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations
* SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk
* SP 800-30, Revision 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
   
### ISO-IEC 27005
Provides guidelines for information security risk management in an organization but does not dictate a specific approach for implementing it.

### OCTAVE
Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE); Risk assessment methodology is divided into three phases.
* Organizational view that defines threat profiles on critical assets
* Look at organization's technology infrastructure to identify vulnerabilities
* Analize and classify individual risks as high, medium, or low and develop mitigations

### FAIR
Proprietary framework for understanding, analyzing, and measuring information risk; the only standard quantitative approach to managing risk.
